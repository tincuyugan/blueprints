# Times

Web/Marketing pre-prio - Tuesday, 18:00 

Mobile pre-prio - Wednesday, 10:45

ASO pre-prio - Wednesday, 11:30

We're planning for 5 days of work (minus conj-time, if we have it on that week), every time, even before the offsite. After the offsite, we're continuing with the previous week's projects, until the first pre-prio, to give time for new projects to materialize and avoid panic on the first Monday after the gathering.

# Before the pre-prio:

#### For Contributors:
1. Look at what you've done last week
2. Put together the plan for next week based on the info you already have (rolling projects, already agreed on new projects)
3. Look at how much free capacity do you have
4. Check if you have upcoming holidays in the next couple of weeks 

#### Project/domain owners:

Look at your project list and prepare before the call by:
1. Listing the new projects ready for others to contribute on
2. Asking for status update (if needed)
3. Plan what state the project could get to by next week
4. Check if there's an upcoming deadline-driven release date approaching 

# Schedule of the call

#### For each contributor, one-by-one:
1. Previous week: Did everything go according to plan? Any rolling projects? Any holidays planned?
2. Previous week: Talk about any overflowing projects.
3. Next week: What will you be working on?
4. Next week: How much free capacity do you have? (This will give project/domain owners a chance to understand what will be possible.)
5. If you have upcoming holidays, ask and coordinate what needs to be done and by when.

#### Project/domain owners:
1. Highlight the projects that they would like to start and we discuss if itâ€™s possible.
2. State the upcoming deadlines for the projects which are ongoing or about to get started.

#### After the call

6. Each individual to write up what they want to accomplish for each project, and how much time are they planning to spend on it in the channel (#planning-capacity). 
7. Update Monday.com (Assign people, update project status, etc.)

# In case of conflict

- If the conflict is on the domain level, let the domain owner decide
- If the conflict is between domains, let the exec sponsor decide
